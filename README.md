## Prerequisites

- Fill out the environment variable values in the `.env` file under the *Application* delimiter.

## Basic Commands

You can build the Docker images by executing the following command:

```
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      docker compose run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.
